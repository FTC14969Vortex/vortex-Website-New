                            I am in 11th grade, and this is my sixth year participating in a FIRST robotics program. I did two years in FLL, and this is my fourth season in FTC. As software lead, I've managed and built this team's code over the past few years, with most notable contributions in odometry, narrow ML vision detection/attribution, teleop automation, and smaller algorithms: ie angle adjustment. I've also planned and executed most of the outreach events, with an amassed 5,000+ people reached, including both professionals in STEM and students. I work on management and have contributed to all subteams. I look forward to my future in STEM and believe FIRST has prepared me well.

I led the programming team for several years but then switched over to the hardware/design subteam last season to try it out, and I’ve been focusing on designing mechanisms ever since. I want to get better at 3D sketches, learn more about new hardware mechanisms, and I want our team to go to the world championships this year! I’m captain of my high school tennis team, proud owner of two rabbits, and an avid enthusiast of camping and the outdoors.

I enjoy programming for being able to experiment with the robot, outreach for the opportunity to connect with and introduce robotics to other people, and documentation it is a vital part of the team. This year, I want to learn more about FTC programming, learn better documentation and time management skills, and hope our team can get as far in the competition as we can. In my free time, I enjoy doing digital art, playing volleyball, and writing.

My goal this year is to expand my programming knowledge, and help the team advance as far as we can. Outside of robotics, my hobbies include reading, writing, and baking.
